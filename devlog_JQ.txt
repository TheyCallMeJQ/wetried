- Division of application of movement to better espouse notion of acceleration. In specific, splitting up the application of motion into three specific phases:
    - The beginning of motion (from rest to a given velocity)
        - This is straight-forward; we just progressively increase the current velocity by the acceleration (ensuring we don't surpass the terminal velocity).
    - The sustaining of the motion (increasing velocity by acceleration, up until we reach a terminal velocity)
    - The ending of motion (coming from any given velocity to rest at the center of the gridbox our movement is mapped to)
        - We should have access to the following information when this phase is triggered:
            - Distance until we come to rest
            - Time in which we want to come to rest, once within the given distance
            - Current velocity
        So from that, we can find the deceleration (the constant rate at which to decrease the velocity such that we come to rest at the given point) by triggering a FindDeceleration() function once we come to within a given distance until we come to rest. Specifically, we have deceleration formula
            D = (Vf - Vi) / t, such that
        D = Deceleration
        Vf = final velocity (0)
        Vi = current velocity
        t = time it takes to come to rest

I was wrong about the acceleration; we can split it into two phases, when we want to accelerate, and when we want to decelerate.
The deceleration itself is defined with respect to a new velocity value that we find based on the distance from the edge of the movement flag prefab's radius as well as the time in which we want to come to a stop. Fixed some minor bugs with the flag, too. We were able to make our velocity progressively greater by quickly spawning the flag multiple times or by spawning the flag, waiting for velocity to accumulate, and then clicking a wall.
